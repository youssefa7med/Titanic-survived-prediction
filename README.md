# Titanic Survived Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, and other attributes. The model is trained on the well-known Titanic dataset.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the Titanic dataset, handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical form.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new features that might improve the model's performance.
- **Model Training**: Trains several machine learning models to predict survival, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
- **Prediction**: Makes predictions on test data or new data inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
